## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dev Patel

I am currently a sophomore at UIC pursuing a CS undergraduate degree. 
This past summer, I worked as an intern on a research paper focused on solving coded cashing problems. We tackled linear equations using Gurobi in Python, an optimization tool that greatly aided our efforts.
